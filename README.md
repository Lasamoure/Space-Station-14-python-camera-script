This is a python script that is still highly experimental for a Space Station 14 camera like effect on in game paper. 
It turns the top file (needs to be an image) in the clipboard into a formatted text buffer that you can paste into ingame paper.

This script will require: 
  -Python (tested on 3.12.0 but should work on most any the modules work with)
  -PIL python module
  -pyperclip Python Module
  -time (if you want to save the images the same way I do)
